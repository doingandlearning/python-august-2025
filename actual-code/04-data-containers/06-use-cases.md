# Tuples

- An ordered group of items that shouldn't change
- A lightweight way to have a record, pair

eg:

(longitude, latitude) -> (0.212, 35.34)
(program_title, duration) -> ("Doctor Who", 59)
(audio_format, bitrate) -> ("MP3", 320)

# Lists

- An ordered collection that might change
- Loop, filter, sort items
- Collecting multiple items of the same kind

eg:

- A list of program titles in a category
- Daily listen count across a week: [3021, 3050, 2990, ...]

- A column in spreadsheet!

# Dictionaries

- You want to associate names with the data
- Fast lookup
- Metadata, attributes

eg:

- A person record: {"name": "Anita", "role": "Editor", "location": "Salford"}
- Audio file metadata: {"filename": "theme.wav", "duration": 12.3, "format": "WAV"}
- Word counts: {"BBC": 42, "news": 12, "radio": 19}
